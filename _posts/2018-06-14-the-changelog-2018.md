I appeared (was heard?) on the latest episode of [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/), and they very kindly sent me the embed snippet for my blog. So to celebrate, I decided to post a blog and use their embed snippet.

If you only came here because of the podcast, enjoy the repetition! Most of my recent content can be found on the [Python at Microsoft](https://aka.ms/pythonblog) blog, or on my [speaking](/speaking) page.
